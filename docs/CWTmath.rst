Basic CWT_Multi theory
=========================================

On this page we provide the basic theory required
to understand how CWT_Multi, and wavelet transforms more generally,
work.
We present ideas and illustrations, rather than comprehensive maths.
Future pages in this documentation will cover the mathematic details.
For now, we refer the reader to Lobo et al. (2024), and include
additional references at the bottom of this page.
